## Toast It! â€“ A Hyper Casual Game Jam Project
Toast It! was a project created during the Hyper Casual Game Jam in 2020. Our project and team were noticed by Orbital Knight, and with their support, we developed the game into a prototype, which went through testing all the way to the MVP stage and was tested on the Voodoo publishing platform. 
Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve the necessary stats to qualify for publishing support from Voodoo. As a result, we decided to fix the remaining bugs and release the app on Google Play and Voodoo independently.
