## OpenXR and VRM Experiment in Unity
This project was an experiment using OpenXR in Unity along with the open VRM format to position virtual avatars (like dolls) in VR space. In the application, you could load a character from a VRM file, set its position using inverse kinematics (IK), and assign animationsâ€”all natively on the Oculus Quest.
