## Using the MVP Pattern in Unity for the Snake Game
This is a very old project of mine (created over 6 years ago in my free time) where I used the MVC pattern to represent the game board in Snake. The code is still available on GitHub and you can take a look at it - I just want to point out that now I would definitely write it much, much better :)
