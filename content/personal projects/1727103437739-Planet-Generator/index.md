## Planet Generator: A Lost but Memorable Early Project
This is definitely one of my oldest projects, which unfortunately got lost with only a few screenshots remaining. However, it's significant enough that I want to write about it. It was a planet generator I was developing for a space exploration survival game. Back then, I didn't realize how massive a challenge creating such a game would be, but I learned a lot from the experience.
The generator was able to create a height map, generate sphere geometry, subdivide and refine it, and place points based on the height map. It could also recursively split the sphere into smaller chunks.
