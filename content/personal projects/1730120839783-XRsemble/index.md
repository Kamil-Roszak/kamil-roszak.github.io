## About The Project

Nowadays, more and more XR devices are emerging, and the market is shifting toward devices priced reasonably for everyday consumers.

Even your average Joe might have a Quest 3S or similar device at home, capable of displaying fully immersive Mixed-Reality experiences. Since we have access to such technology, why not use it to make everyday life easier?

Servicing devices, replacing worn-out parts, assembling furnitureâ€”all of it could be simplified when the user sees a real representation of the process in full 3D!

**XRsemble** is an app for XR devices that provides immersive, step-by-step service / assembly instructions in full 3D. Users can create and customize their own instructions, making assembly simple and interactive with the ability to view parts from any angle.
