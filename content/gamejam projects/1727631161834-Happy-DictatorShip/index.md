## GameJam Project: Smile or Perish
This was a GameJam project at Poznan University of Technology, combining machine learning with Unity. The premise of the game is simple: the player lives in a world where the political doctrine forbids showing negative emotions. The player's task is to smile at the right momentsâ€”literally smile. The game incorporates OpenSeeFace for facial tracking using a webcam, integrated with the gameplay.
