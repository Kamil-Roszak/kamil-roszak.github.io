## Suppliers: A United with Ukraine Game Jam Project
![map](map.png "Gameplay")
Suppliers is a game created by me and my friends as part of the United with Ukraine Game Jam, which aimed to develop projects centered around Ukraine and its role in Europe. In the game we created, the player's goal is to manage resources produced in various European countries (based on their real-world strengths) and strategically allocate them to achieve the final objective.
